ðŸ§  AgensGraph AI Tools and Libraries
====================================

Welcome to [AgensGraph AI](https://github.com/skaiworldwide-oss/agensgraph-ai) â€” a curated collection of tools, integrations, and starter templates for building AI-powered applications that work with [AgensGraph](https://github.com/skaiworldwide-oss/agensgraph), a PostgreSQL-based multi-model graph database.

This repository currently includes:
* [LangChain](./langchain/) â€” LLM agents, tools, and chains
* [LlamaIndex](./llama-index/) â€” custom data indexing and retrieval
* [LightRag](./lightrag/) â€” graph-aware RAG for accurate, context-rich retrieval

> âœ… Each library has its own subfolder with a dedicated README to guide you through setup and usage.

# ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This repository is designed to help developers:
* Integrate AgensGraph with modern LLM frameworks
* Leverage graph data in conversational and intelligent apps
* Explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agents, and graph reasoning

Everything is open-source and modular â€” feel free to use, fork, or contribute.
