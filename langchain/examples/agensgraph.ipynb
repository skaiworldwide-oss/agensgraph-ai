    "\n",
    ">[AgensGraph](https://github.com/skaiworldwide-oss/agensgraph) is a cutting-edge multi-model graph database designed for modern complex data environments. By supporting both relational and graph data models simultaneously, AgensGraph allows developers to seamlessly integrate legacy relational data with the flexible graph data model within a single database. AgensGraph is built on the robust PostgreSQL RDBMS, providing a highly reliable, fully-featured platform ready for enterprise use.\n",

    "You will need to have a running `Agensgraph` instance. One option for testing is to run a docker container using the official [Agensgraph](https://hub.docker.com/r/skaiworldwide/agensgraph) docker image.\n",
    "You can run a local docker container by executing the following script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -d \\\n",
    "    --name agensgraph \\\n",
    "    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=agensgraph \\\n",
